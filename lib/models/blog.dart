    "The world today is becoming a more travel-friendly place. Societies are encouraging people to go out there and explore.\n\nMovies, books and songs are emphasising that travelling is cool. Websites like Airbnb, TripAdvisor and HostelWorld have opened up travel to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nThe travel bug has bitten Bangladesh too, with a lot of young people now keen to discover the unchartered territories of this beautiful country. And just like the rest of the world, Bengali women are also becoming more courageous.Gone are the days when girls were restricted to the house and told they could travel with their future husbands. There are many women today who travel by themselves or in groups – which was unthinkable even a few years back.A lot of reasons have contributed to this change.\n\nMany girls moved abroad to pursue higher education and learn to be independent as a result. Local universities also have batch trips both in Bangladesh and overseas. ",
    "Every summer, when images of elite athletes cycling along some of the most stunning, bucolic and treacherous routes in France are broadcast around the world, we’re reminded of the beauty of the sport.\n\nBut it’s not just France that boasts postcard-perfect countrysides and heart-pumping hillsides. With the Tour de France in full swing, here’s a selection of other epic bike routes around the world that include trails for everything from the novice, recreational cyclist to the daredevil who makes sport of flirting with death. \n\nLa Route Verte, Quebec National Geographic has called La Route Verte, the largest bike network in North America, the most beautiful cycling route in the world. Spanning 5,000 km and linking up different regions of Quebec, it crosses through 320 municipalities. Itineraries include the St. Lawrence River, the mountains of the Laurentides and the far reaches of Gaspésie in the north.",
    "The theme for this year’s International Women’s Day (March 8) is #BalanceforBetter. It focuses on how a more gender-balanced world can create a better working environment for all. \n\nAccording to a report by The Adventure Travel Trade Association, women have been long under-represented in the outdoor travel scene, especially in leadership positions. A report entitled Out in Front: Tracking Women’s Leadership in Adventure Travel stated that while women made up 60%-70% of the travel industry, only 38% of board positions were held by females in the adventure sector. \n\nThere are also significantly fewer female guides on average, especially in developing destinations. But, women are beginning to break down the barriers of this male-dominated sector, and along with the rise of the female adventurer and women’s-only travel providers, there is a marked increase in women taking on more leadership roles.",
    "Himalayan Airlines, one of the private carriers of Nepal is going to commence Kathmandu-Dhaka-Kathmandu direct flight from Monday. \n\nThe airline will operate three weekly flights by its A320-214 narrow bodied aircraft, configured with 150 economy class and eight premium economy class seats, a press release said here today. On the occasion, acting Nepalese Ambassador to Bangladesh Dhan Bahadur Oli emphasized strengthening connectivity between the two countries on all fronts saying that there is huge potential to promote Bangladesh-Nepal bilateral relations. \n\nWhen we talk about connectivity, we don’t talk about one-way connectivity, he said at a function at the Nepal embassy here on Thursday last. Himalaya Airlines Bangladesh Country Manager Sushil Kumar Basnet said the ticket price will be cheaper compare to other airlines. \n\nWith the airlines regular flights to Middle East destinations like Doha, Dubai and Dammam, the new sector shall also significantly project Kathmandu as a transit hub for Bangladeshi passengers. This connectivity will boost new business opportunities between Nepal and Bangladesh and shall also serve as a bridge between the Middle East countries and Bangladesh, the release said quoted the airlines vice president Vijay Shrestha. \n\nThe thrice weekly schedules have convenient timings, where flight will depart from Kathmandu at 11:10 am (local time) and land at 1:10 pm (local time) in Dhaka while the return flight depart Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 2:10 pm hours (local time) and arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport at 3:20 pm. The airline has appointed SAir Air BD Ltd as its general sales agents.",
    "People with disabilities can travel the world. All it takes is some smart planning. \n\nThere's a famous quote that's been used and abused over the years to urge people to travel to other countries and meet other cultures. Basically, it says that the world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.It's an interesting quote - and while there is some truth to it - it can be argued that it smacks of privilege. \n\nI mean, there are many among us who can't travel or find travel exceedingly difficult due to different reasons. Some of us can't travel and tour because we don't have the money to do so. And there are those who find travel challenging because they or their loved ones have to overcome the obstacles that physical disabilities throw their way. \n\nHowever, having said that, I have come to learn that travel is not impossible for a person with a disability - such as a wheelchair user - as long as you're willing to plan ahead and do your homework ahead of time. This is something I've learned the hard way, having been a caregiver and travel companion of a wheelchair user in the past. \n\nAnd from my experience, good planning begins at least two months before the holiday kicks off; I would often contact the airline - ideally by email to have everything in black and white - approximately eight weeks before the flight to ascertain what documentation we would need to prepare, such as doctor's letters and other medical forms so that such paperwork could be completed in time for the flight.",
